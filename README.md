# OCD-patients-dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project for OCD patients in Power BI, created multiple dashboards and charts to analyze the dataset and visually represented the required KPI's. Process involved were Data Processing, Data Cleaning using power query and data visualization.

# Requirements :
1. I have built KPI's which gave a general view of number of OCD patients by gender.
2. With the help of charts, we can identify Obsessions and compulsions of different people and the age it affects the most.
3. Dashboard was built with neat visualisations making easier for the client to read.

# CHARTS USED :
1. PIE chart for representing the Y BCOS obsession type
2. Scatter chart for representing Severity by gender. This would give us an idea which gender is affected the most.
3. Funnel chart to show number of patients and their compulsions
4. Slicers used to select the desired option for Ethnicity.
